# TDDVT
Test Driven Development
TDD, means you write a failing test first, and add as little code as possible to make it pass. As you go, there can be multiple steps you need to take before a test eventually passes. When all your assertions are verified, your feature is complete. Therefore, when all tests pass, your app code will already be covered by unit tests. You don’t need to spend extra time to add tests afterward.

TDD is performed with the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. The three steps are:

RED – Write a failing test
GREEN – Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass
REFACTOR – Refactor both the app code and test code
